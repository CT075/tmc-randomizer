This program creates a randomized version of The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap.

Current version: 0.1.0a

### Current Logic
At the moment, all key items, gold kinstones, and quest items are randomized. We plan to extend this as far as possible within the game. **Due to the alpha nature of the software, we can't promise every seed is completable! Let us know where you got stuck in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ndFuWbV) and we'll check it out.**

### Usage
Download the latest zip from the [releases](https://github.com/minishmaker/randomizer/releases) page, you'll need all the files it comes with for now. Choose a seed or leave it default, then hit randomize. You'll need to provide an EU copy of Minish Cap, don't ask us where to get one. Hitting 'Save ROM' will prompt you to save the randomized game. You can also save a spoiler log if you get stuck.

### Known Issues
- Spoiler log could be much clearer, we're working on that. Let us know in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ndFuWbV) and we'll tell you what it means.
- Any route requiring chests on the bottom floor of Deepwood shrine (aside from the compass chest) are broken, as the lilypad doesn't spawn.
- The game softlocks after defeating Mazaal, the boss in Fortress of Winds.
- Items such as spin attack, bombs, fairy fountains, can still be obtained the way the game intends.

We're also working on trackers for assisting with the randomizer, and would love any and all feedback.
